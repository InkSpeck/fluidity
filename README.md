What it is?
==========
Fluidity is an extremely lightweight CSS framework made for web designers who want a framework simple enough to quickly express their ideas, smart enough to help with the mundane, and lean enough to stay out of the way when the time comes to do some serious design.

It's built using the awesome Stylesheet language Stylus and all the super powers it has for working with CSS. Fluidity contains a complete CSS reset, some base-line typography, a grid system that can be used semantically or with inline classes to create both fluid-width and fixed-width designs, a collection of transparent mixins that gracefully handle browser pre-fixes for CSS3 properties, and it also has some optional modules for forms and common UI elements.

Who's it for?
============
Fluidity is for any web designer that knows how to use CSS and want to use CSS3 features now, a fluid semantic and responsive grid, and code their CSS in a clean and maintainable way using a powerful stylesheet language. There is a slight learning curve for designers who have never used Stylus before, so it is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the Stylus Stylesheet language and the Node.js enivironment. Both Node.js and Stylus are required to use Fluidity.

What it is not?
==============

It is not a web design in a box. If you want a great looking design it's up to you to design it.

It is not a giant collection of classes to memorize. In fact, if you use HTML5 and the provided semantic grid, Fluidity will not require you to add any classes to your mark up.

It is not a library of widgets. While some designed UI elements like pills & tabs are provided in the optional modules there is no javascript provided for their functionality it's up to you to implement them.

It is not a collection of javascript plugins. In fact, no javascript is included with Fluidity at all, with the exception of some Node/Npm packaging stuff in the source which is not a part Fluidity itself.

It is not a series of shims, fixes, or browser hacks. Fluidity is targeted directly at HTML5. The CSS3 Mixins are transparent CSS3 syntax and cross-browser prefixes are handled with a vendors variable. If you have difficult browser compatibility requirements and need support for older browsers it is up to you to provide the shims and/or monkey patches.
